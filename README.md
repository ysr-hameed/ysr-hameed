<h1>Hey I'm Yasir Hameed</h1>

 About Me
I’m a full-stack web developer who loves building modern, fast, and reliable web applications.  
Over the years, I’ve worked with a variety of technologies and frameworks — from backend APIs to frontend interfaces — and I enjoy every part of the process.  

I don’t stick to one stack. I’ve used Node.js, React, Python, Laravel, and many others depending on what fits best for the project.  
I also like using AI tools and APIs inside my apps to make them more efficient and smarter for users.  

For me, clean code, usability, and performance always come first.
